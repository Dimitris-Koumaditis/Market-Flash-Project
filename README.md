# Market Flash Project

For this project I needed to analyse, clean the data and create a dashboard to present:


**1) Campaigns overview:** Summary of key metrics such as total spend, average spend, total engagements, average engagements, conversions and ROI.

**2) Channel performance:** The performance for each channel.

**3) Engagement:** Engagement an performance charts by demographic or client.

**4) Trends Analysis:** Monthly trends.

**5) ROI Analysis:** Cost per conversion and/or ROI per campaign.
